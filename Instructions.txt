In order to run the .jar file, the latest version of the JavaFX SDK (15.0.1) should be installed. Then, the following command should be entered in the command prompt, after navigating to the directory which contains the Player.jar file:

java --module-path "*JavaFXDirectory" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar Player.jar

Replace *JavaFXDirectory* with the location of the /lib/ folder of your JavaFX installation.
